# [Hierarchical Equations of Motion Liouvillian Superoperator (HEOMLS) Matrix](@id doc-HEOMLS-Matrix)
The hierarchical equations of motion Liouvillian superoperator (HEOMLS) ``\hat{\mathcal{M}}`` characterizes the dynamics in the full [auxiliary density operators (ADOs)](@ref doc-ADOs) space, namely 
```math
\partial_{t}\rho^{(m,n,p)}_{\textbf{j} \vert \textbf{q}}(t)=\hat{\mathcal{M}}\rho^{(m,n,p)}_{\textbf{j} \vert \textbf{q}}(t)
```
and it can, numerically, be expressed as a matrix. 

The HEOMLS ``\hat{\mathcal{M}}`` not only characterizes the bare system dynamics (based on system Hamiltonian) but also encodes the system-and-multiple-bosonic-baths and system-and-multiple-fermionic-baths interactions (based on the exponential-expansion terms of the corresponding bath-correlation functions).
